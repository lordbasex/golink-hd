/*
 * go-link HD's API: how a host program runs the engine. go-link's device
 * (from Go), the headless runner and the tests are hosts; Willy Maker's play
 * mode will be one in WebAssembly.
 *
 * The contract, in short:
 *   - create an engine, load a game package (.glhd) or start a built-in demo;
 *   - every 1/60 s give it the players' controllers and run one frame: it
 *     returns the picture (XRGB8888) and the sound of that frame (48 kHz
 *     stereo, 800 samples);
 *   - save and load its state at any frame: the same state and the same
 *     controllers give the same pictures and sound on every computer.
 *
 * Compatibility: GOLINKHD_API_VERSION grows when the API grows. A host asks
 * for the version it was written for (golinkhd_config.api_version) and an
 * engine serves every older one; functions are only added, never changed.
 * Save states and packages carry versions of their own (see the README).
 *
 * The idea of a small, frontend-agnostic contract (load, run a frame, give a
 * picture and sound, serialize the state) comes from libretro's API, which
 * this engine followed at first; it now has its own, so it can grow with
 * what go-link needs (events for the room, views per player, several engines
 * in one program).
